# INTRODUCTION 
This project was made as a Hobby Project, It contains 13 different AI tools that boosts your productivity and enhances creativity, I wanted to make something for personal use for creating images , non-ai text generation and later decided to make it as a full fledged fullstack project, That doesn't only help me but my fellow learners as well.


## API Routes üñ•Ô∏è

- **api/**
  - **ai-detection/**  
  - **auth/**  
  - **caption/**  
  - **chat/**  
  - **code/**  
  - **object-detection/**  
  - **paid/**  
  - **paraphrase/**  
  - **sign-up/**  
  - **summarizer/**  
  - **text-to-image/**  
  - **translator/**  

Each route serves an authenticated API endpoint and serves as their purpose.
